Areas of Expertise
VLSI Design

I am currently focused on VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) design, which involves designing and developing integrated circuits. My coursework and projects have given me a solid foundation in this field.
Verilog

Verilog is a hardware description language used for modeling electronic systems. I am proficient in Verilog and have experience in using it for various digital design projects.
Programming Languages

I have a strong command of several programming languages, including:

    Python: Python is my go-to language for general-purpose programming, data analysis, and automation.
    C++: I am skilled in C++ for software development and system-level programming.

Cadence

Cadence Design Systems provides a suite of tools for electronic design automation (EDA). I am familiar with using Cadence tools in the design and verification of integrated circuits.

Collaboration

I am always open to collaboration on interesting projects, research, or discussions related to VLSI design or any of my areas of expertise. Feel free to contact me if you have an opportunity or idea you'd like to explore together.
Let's Connect!

I look forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals in the field of VLSI design and related technologies. Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me through the provided contact information.

Thank you for visiting my README, and I'm excited to explore opportunities and share knowledge with you!
